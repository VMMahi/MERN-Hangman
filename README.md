This is the Hangman that I've created using the React Framework for the frontend and Express JS for the Backend
<br />
You need to have mongodb installed on your system and running on port 27017, as I have configured the models in the backend.
The backend will run on port 4000<br />
Steps to activate the backend:<br />
1. cd into the backend<br />
2. run command "npm run dev"<br />
<br />
<br />
The frontend will run on port 3000 which is the default port for react app.<br />
Steps to activate the frontend:<br />
1. cd into the frontend folder <br />
2. run command "npm start"

You're Hangman game is ready to play! Have Fun!
(Note: Always activate the backend first for any project, then start the frontend)
